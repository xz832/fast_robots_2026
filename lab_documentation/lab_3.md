# LAB 3 - MAE4190 FAST ROBOTS

Welcome to lab 3 of fast robots!

## Prelab

You can change the address programmatically (while powered) or you can continuously enable/disable the two sensors separately through their shutdown pins. Decide and argue for which approach you want to use (and how you will do this). Given their range and angular sensitivity, think about where you will place them on your robot to best detect obstacles in future labs. Discuss scenarios where your robot will miss obstacles.

Think about which connections you want to be detachable and which can be permanent
Think about which side of the sensors you mount the wires from.
Think about the placement of each sensor in the chassis and how long the wires have to be.

Prelab
Note the I2C sensor address
Briefly discuss the approach to using 2 ToF sensors
Briefly discuss placement of sensors on robot and scenarios where you will miss obstacles
Sketch of wiring diagram (with brief explanation if you want)
